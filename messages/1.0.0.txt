Elm Syntax Highlighting - 1.0.0 - 7 August 2019
===============================================


New Design
----------

Instead of having a bunch of functionality packed into one
package (some of it in disrepair) we now have two highly
specific packages:

- https://github.com/evancz/elm-syntax-highlighting
- https://github.com/evancz/elm-format-on-save

So you now have syntax highlighting that should be reliable
through future releases.

The new design is described in more detail here:

  https://github.com/evancz/elm-syntax-highlighting

It outlines a recommended workflow as well.


Adding back "Elm Format on Save"
--------------------------------

Check out the install instructions here:

  https://github.com/evancz/elm-format-on-save/

The new package for running elm-format when you save a file
has some important changes:

1. It expects 0.19 code.
2. It runs *before* a file is written to disk.

The previous implementation ran *after* the file was saved,
causing a second save with the formatted code. So point (2)
is really important for people with file watchers, allowing
you to avoid a bunch of pointless work.
